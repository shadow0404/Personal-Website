            I&apos;m 21, turning 22 in April. Last year, I lived in three countries, worked four jobs, 
            co-founded a non-profit, and figured out what makes me happy. (Spoiler: it&apos;s not what I expected.)
          </p>

            Most people see policy as abstract—numbers in reports, theories in papers. I see it differently. 
            I see Ukrainian veterans who can&apos;t sleep, Aboriginal communities fighting for their land, 
            students drowning in broken systems. Policy is just the story of how we decide who gets help 
            and who doesn&apos;t.

            I grew up in a third-tier city in India. My dad&apos;s first salary after a major accident was 
            $100 a month. We lived in a house where water dripped through the ceiling. Now I study at 
            TCU on a full ride, work at a DC think tank analyzing healthcare and trade policy, and somehow 
            ended up advising organizations in South Africa and Australia.

            At 16, I built Cancer-Ex—the world&apos;s first saliva-based pancreatic cancer test. Cost: $1.75. 
            Won India&apos;s highest civilian award for students. Raised $80K. Then I left it. I have this 
            pattern: I start things, work obsessively for months, then lose interest. Cancer research, 
            the think tank job I worked so hard to get, even the NGO I co-founded. I&apos;m trying to figure 
            out if that&apos;s a bug or a feature.

            Last year in Cape Town, I was the happiest I&apos;ve ever been. Not because of the work (policy 
            consulting for land reform), but because I stopped running toward the next thing. I learned 
            to swim in the ocean for the first time. Played tennis every other day. Spent time with 
            people I actually liked. For once, I wasn&apos;t optimizing for the future.

            Now I&apos;m back in Texas, trying to find that feeling again. I work on tariff analysis at FREOPP, 
            run a veterans&apos; mental health non-profit, and take 60+ coffee chats because I&apos;m good at 
            selling myself even when I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;m selling. I speak four languages, use R and SQL, 
            and think too much about why systems fail.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don&apos;t know what I want to do next. But I know I want to work on things that matter, 
            with people who tell me what I need to hear instead of what I want to hear. Everything 
            else is negotiable.
